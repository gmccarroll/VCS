Yes, there are a couple of known bugs. For 
example:

  o A few methods that are currently documented
    are not actually implemented. So far, you only
    have read access to RCS and CVS repositories..
    
  o Caching is done inside the Rcs.pm and Cvs.pm
    libraries, while it should probably be inside
    the Rcs::File and Cvs::File libraries.
    
  o Caching doesn't work for long-lived processes.
    
  o vcsweb.cgi does not run correctly with tainting
  
But hopefully that's about it ;-)
